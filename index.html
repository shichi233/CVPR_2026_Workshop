        <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
        <p>The recent surge of multimodal large models has brought unprecedented progress in connecting language, vision, audio, and beyond. Yet, despite their impressive performance, most existing systems remain constrained to fixed modality pairs, lacking the flexibility to generalize or reason across arbitrary modality combinations. This limitation stands in contrast to human cognition, which fluidly integrates diverse sensory channels to build a coherent understanding of the world. The Any-to-Any Multimodal Learning (A2A-MML) workshop aims to explore the next frontier of multimodal intelligence—developing systems capable of understanding, aligning, transforming, and generating across any set of modalities. We organize the discussion around three foundational pillars: (1) Multimodal representation learning, which seeks to learn generalizable and disentangled representations that capture both shared and modality-specific information; (2) Multimodal transformation, which investigates architectures and principles enabling seamless translation, fusion, and adaptation across heterogeneous modalities; and (3) Multimodal collaboration, which studies how modalities cooperate, complement, or conflict with each other to achieve coherent reasoning and world modeling. By bringing together researchers from vision, language, audio, 3D, robotics, and cognitive science, this workshop aims to establish a roadmap toward any-to-any multimodal intelligence, where machines can perceive, reason, and communicate across modalities as fluidly as humans do.</p>

        <h2>1 WORKSHOP SUMMARY</h2>

        <h3>1.1 BACKGROUND AND MOTIVATION</h3>
        <p>Multimodal learning has rapidly evolved from early dual-modality systems (e.g., text–image) to powerful multimodal foundation models that integrate vision, language, and audio. However, the community is now facing a crucial inflection point. Despite significant progress, today’s models still operate under narrow and rigid modality pairings, limited supervision settings, and task-specific adaptation schemes. This rigidity prevents them from achieving the combinatorial generalization that underlies human-like perception and reasoning. Humans, by contrast, seamlessly integrate multiple sensory modalities—sight, sound, touch, spatial awareness, and language—into coherent, context-aware understanding. Realizing this capability in AI requires a paradigm shift from “multi-to-one” or “one-to-one” fusion toward any-to-any multimodal learning.</p>
        <p>The A2A-MML workshop is motivated by three core needs currently underserved in the community: 1) Mechanistic and representational understanding, 2) Broader modality coverage and flexible interaction, and 3) Methodological openness beyond foundation models. In uniting these perspectives, A2A-MML aims to serve as a cross-disciplinary bridge, linking representation learning, cognitive modeling, embodied AI, and generative modeling. The workshop will feature keynote talks, paper presentations, and panel discussions that collectively address one central question: How can we move from isolated multimodal systems to a universal, any-to-any multimodal learner that understands and generates across all sensory forms of the world?</p>
        <p><strong>Tagline.</strong> Bridging Representation, Transformation, and Collaboration Toward Any-to-Any Multimodal Intelligence</p>
        <p><strong>Workshop Acronym.</strong> A2A-MML: Any-to-Any Multimodal Learning</p>

        <h3>1.2 TOPICS AND THEMES</h3>
        <p>We welcome all relevant submissions in the area of multimodal learning, with particular emphasis on emerging advances and open challenges in any-to-any multimodal intelligence, such as:</p>
        <p><strong>1) Multimodal Representation Learning.</strong> Multimodal joint representation (Wang et al., 2024b; Girdhar et al., 2023; Zhu et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2024a), which seeks to relate and decompose information inherent in multiple modalities, forms the foundation of current multimodal retrieval (Liu et al., 2025), understanding (Han et al., 2023), and generation (Wu et al., 2024) pipelines. We invite contributions that explore how to disentangle modality-specific factors from modality-invariant information, learn generalizable alignment spaces under weak or unpaired supervision, and enhance interpretability, robustness, and compositionality in multimodal representations. Works that connect representation learning with grounded reasoning or unified architectures are particularly encouraged.</p>
        <p><strong>2) Multimodal Transformation.</strong> Multimodal transformation focuses on how information can be transferred, translated, or generated across heterogeneous modalities, such as text-to-image (Li et al., 2019; Peebles &amp; Xie, 2023), image-to-video (Hu, 2024; Ni et al., 2023), video-to-audio (Liu et al., 2024; Luo et al., 2023), or beyond (Mizrahi et al., 2023; Jakubik et al., 2025; Parker et al., 2025). We welcome submissions that investigate mechanisms enabling smooth modality conversion and adaptation, including shared latent spaces and the diffusion transformer framework. We also encourage studies on asymmetric and zero-shot modality transfer, bidirectional generation, and the theoretical understanding of modality transformation under limited or noisy supervision, or its emergent capabilities.</p>
        <p><strong>3) Multimodal Synergtic Collaboration.</strong> True multimodal intelligence requires more than alignment, it demands collaboration among modalities (Tang et al., 2025; Yin et al., 2025; Fei et al., 2022). This theme emphasizes how modalities interact, complement, and compensate for one another during perception and reasoning. We invite research on multimodal synergy mechanisms such as collaborative attention, cross-modal feedback loops, co-learning paradigms, and compositional reasoning across modalities. Topics of interest include discovering when and how modalities cooperate or conflict, and designing architectures that explicitly model modality interaction and synergy.</p>
        <p><strong>4) Benchmarking and Evaluation for Any-to-Any Multimodal learning.</strong> To measure progress toward general multimodal intelligence, robust and extensible evaluation protocols are essential (Su et al., 2021; Liang et al., 2021; Kil et al., 2024; Fei et al., 2025). We encourage works that develop benchmarks or diagnostic tasks evaluating arbitrary modality combinations, multimodal generalization, and transformation fidelity. We also welcome new evaluation metrics for alignment quality, interpretability, synergy, and reasoning consistency. Studies analyzing failure cases, dataset biases, or modality imbalance in current multimodal models are highly relevant.</p>
        <p>Other topics of interest include, but are not limited to: (i) unified multimodal foundation and agentic models, (ii) representation learning for embodied and interactive systems, (iii) integration of underexplored modalities (e.g., 3D, tactile, temporal, physiological, or environmental data), and (iv) theoretical and cognitive perspectives on multimodal perception and reasoning.</p>

        <h3>1.3 BROADER IMPACT STATEMENT</h3>
        <p>This workshop aims to cultivate a deeper and more unified understanding of multimodal intelligence, beyond the current siloed vision–language paradigm. By emphasizing the mechanisms behind alignment, transformation, and collaboration, we hope to inspire research that is not only more generalizable and interpretable but also more grounded in real-world multimodal diversity. Encouraging contributions from interdisciplinary communities (e.g., vision, language, audio, robotics, neuroscience, and cognitive science), this workshop will help bridge representation and reasoning across modalities, paving the way for systems that can interact naturally with humans and the physical world. We envision that fostering such understanding will advance trustworthy AI systems capable of reasoning, adapting, and communicating seamlessly across modalities and contexts.</p>

        <h3>1.4 RELATIONSHIP TO PREVIOUS WORKSHOPS</h3>
        <p>Several recent workshops have explored themes relevant to our focus, including the BEAM 2025: Benchmarking and Expanding AI Multimodal Approaches-CVPR25, Emergent Visual Abilities and Limits of Foundation Models (EVAL-FoMo 2) - CVPR25, What is Next in Multimodal Foundation Models? - CVPR25, Workshop on Video Large Language Models - CVPR25, 8th Multimodal Learning and Applications Workshop - CVPR25, Workshop Series on Multimodal Fact-Checking and Hate Speech Detection - AAAI25. While these workshops have greatly advanced multimodal research from the perspectives of model scaling, performance benchmarking, and downstream applications, our Any-to-Any Multimodal Learning (A2A-MML) workshop is distinguished by the following aspects:</p>
        <p><strong>1) Emphasis on mechanistic and representational understanding.</strong> Our workshop focuses on the “why” and “how” of modality alignment and compliment, rather than purely on performance gains. We aim to explore questions such as: What kinds of information are shared or complementary across modalities? How can modalities be aligned, transformed, and coordinated in different combinations? We believe this kind of mechanistic and explanatory investigation is relatively underrepresented in existing workshops.</p>
        <p><strong>3) Broader modality coverage and flexible modality interaction.</strong> We explicitly encourage research that goes beyond the typical vision–language (or vision–language–audio/video) settings, and welcome work involving sensors, 3D data, haptics, temporal signals, physiological or medical signals, and more. In particular, we want to encourage researchers to design alignment, transformation, and interaction mechanisms across arbitrary combinations of modalities.</p>
        <p><strong>3) Methodological openness beyond foundation models.</strong> While foundation or pre-trained models are welcome, our workshop embraces methodological diversity. We encourage contributions that explore alternative paradigms, such as self-supervised, contrastive, reinforcement, or modular learning, for understanding the principles of multimodal representation and interaction. This openness enables A2A-ML to serve as a unifying platform for both foundation-model researchers and those pursuing lightweight, mechanistic, or theoretically grounded multimodal systems.</p>

        <p>The program will consist of three main components: (1) Invited keynote talks, (2) Oral and poster presentations of accepted papers, and (3) A closing panel discussion featuring invited speakers, focusing on future directions and open challenges in unified multimodal intelligence. Poster sessions will be conducted onsite with dedicated time for interactive discussions. For remote attendees, we will offer a virtual poster gallery and live Q&amp;A channels to ensure inclusive engagement.</p>
        <p>Given the rapidly growing importance of multimodal understanding as a foundation for artificial general intelligence (AGI), particularly for world modeling, embodied reasoning, and robotic construction, we propose to organize this workshop as a full-day event. Despite recent advances in integrating vision, language, audio, and other modalities, fundamental challenges remain unsolved, including how to achieve efficient transformation, alignment, and collaboration across heterogeneous modalities. Addressing these issues is critical for advancing unified and interpretable multimodal intelligence. Our A2A-MML workshop directly targets these questions and has attracted several confirmed and tentative speakers who are leading researchers in multimodal representation learning, cross-modal reasoning, and interactive intelligence. A full-day format will allow sufficient time for keynote talks, oral and poster sessions, and in-depth discussions, facilitating meaningful interactions and cross-domain exchange.</p>
        <p><strong>Important Dates for Review Process.</strong> We will follow the suggested dates by CVPR.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Workshop paper submission deadline: March 20, 2026.</li>
          <li>Workshop paper notification date: April 5, 2026</li>
          <li>Final workshop program, camera-ready, videos uploaded: April 12, 2026</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3.2 TARGET AUDIENCE AND ANTICIPATED AUDIENCE SIZE</h3>
        <p>This workshop is intended for three main groups: (1) Academic researchers, including professors and graduate students working on multimodal intelligence, multimedia analysis, and cross-modal learning; (2) Industry practitioners, specifically data scientists and engineers developing multimodal applications; and (3) Broader participants from startups, government agencies, and interdisciplinary domains interested in latest multimodal AI advances. We plan a hybrid format, with the majority of participants attending in person. We expect around 100-300 on-site and 80+ virtual participants.</p>

        <h3>3.3 PAPER SUBMISSION AND ACCEPTANCE</h3>
        <p>We welcome technical, position, or perspective papers related to the topics outlined in Section 1.2. All submissions must be written in English, follow the official CVPR proceedings format, and adhere to the double-blind review policy.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Tiny or Short Papers (2–4 pages) — We invite concise papers that present implementations and evaluations of unpublished but insightful ideas, moderate yet self-contained theoretical analyses, follow-up experiments, re-analyses of prior work, or new perspectives on existing research.</li>
          <li>Regular Papers (up to 8 pages, including figures and tables) — We encourage submissions introducing original methods (e.g., architectures, training paradigms), novel research visions, applications, or discussions of open challenges in multimodal learning.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We plan to accept approximately 25 papers in total. All accepted papers will be presented as posters during the workshop, and 6–8 of them will be selected for short oral presentations. A Best Paper Award will be presented based on reviewer scores and the workshop committee’s evaluation.</p>

        <h3>3.4 REVIEW PROCESS</h3>
        <p>We will use OpenReview to organize the review cycle. Each paper will be reviewed by three PC members. Besides, we will provide review guidelines to express our expectations for the reviews. Authors will mark conflicts of interest with the workshop organizers and the program committee, and the review will be handled accordingly. Organizers are allowed to submit their own works to the workshop, as OpenReview disables the visibility of PC assignments and reviews, while another organizer can handle the decision-making for that submission.</p>

        <h3>3.5 POTENTIAL PROGRAM COMMITTEE MEMBERS</h3>
        <p>We anticipate approximately 30–40 valid submissions. To ensure each paper receives three high-quality reviews while limiting reviewer load to a maximum of 3 papers. To oversee the review process, we will appoint a small number of Senior Program Committee (SPC) members to assist with reviewer recruitment, assignment, and quality control. Below is a preliminary list of confirmed and invited PC/SPC members.</p>
        <p>Lizi Liao (SMU, Singapore), Wei Ji (Nanjing University, CN), Xintao Wang (Kuaishou Technology), Weicai Ye (Kuaishou Technology), Kevin Lin (Microsoft Azure AI, USA), Giorgos Tolias (CTU, Czech), Xiangtai Li (NTU, Singapore), Bo Han (Hong Kong Baptist University, CN HK), Efstratios Gavves (UvA, Netherlands), Xiatian Zhu (University of Surrey, UK), Juncheng Li (Zhejiang University, CN), Long Chen (HKUST, CN HK), Xingya Du (University of Texas at Dallas, USA), Qian Liu (University of Auckland, New Zealand), Yichen Li (MIT CSAIL, US), Boyang Deng (Stanford University, US), Zhengfei Kuang (Stanford University, US), Xiaoxiao Sun (Stanford University, US), Xuan Ju (CUHK, CN HK), Yu (Bryan) Zhou (UCLA, US), Shenhan Qian (Technical University of Munich, Germany), Chengzu Li (University of Cambridge, UK), Xingyu Fu (Princeton University, US), Daohan Lu (NYU, US), JOY HSU (Stanford University, US), DaoAn Zhang (University of Rochester, US), Jiafei Duan (University of Washington, US), Yukang Yang (Princeton University, US), Zijian Zhou (King’s College London, UK), Jinjie Mai (KAUST, KSA), Junhao Zhang (Google, US), Jiawei Liu (Meta FAIR, US), Zhijie Deng (Shanghai Jiao Tong University, CN), Qinghong Lin (University of Oxford, UK), Yuchao Gu (National Univeristy of Singapore, SG).</p>

        <h3>3.6 WORKSHOP PROMOTION</h3>
        <p>The workshop will be promoted through multiple channels. A dedicated website will host detailed information about the agenda, speakers, and registration process. In addition to the website, we will utilize social media platforms, including X and LinkedIn, to expand our reach to a wider audience. Organizers and speakers will be encouraged to share the event within their networks. Accepted papers will be posted on the workshop website, with an option to publish them on arXiv, noting their association with the event. After the workshop, we will strive to make slides and recordings of the talks available online.</p>
